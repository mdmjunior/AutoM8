# AutoM8 - Linux Ubuntu Setup Tool

</div>

Autom8 isn't a new or revolutionary idea, to be honest is really easy to find another set of scripts that does the same into
several operating systems. I started it at first, to improve my scripting skills, but as I was developing, new ideas come up and
this is becoming bigger than I supposed.

The project is still under development, but I will share some notes, workflow and the Ideas for future improvements.

## Introduction

AutoM8 is the ultimate tool for linux users to manage their Ubuntu Station. It provides a huge set of commands to automate the installation of
software on your computer.

## Workflow

Not done yet.

## Ideas

- Automate the installation of everything
- Increase productivity
- Easy on-board of new DevOps or Developers
- Unify all the tools in just one app
- Uninstall not needed software on Ubuntu
- Keep track of what was installed

**The list bellow contains the task I want to automate:**

- Create new users and groups
- Crate ssh and gpg keys for users
- Change bash aliases and prompt
- Install other shells than bash
- Change timezone
- Change hostname
