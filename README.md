# AutoM8 - Linux Ubuntu Setup Tool

</div>

Autom8 isn't a new or revolutionary idea, to be honest is really easy to find another set of scripts that does the same into
several operating systems. I started it at first, to improve my scripting skills, but as I was developing, new ideas come up and
this is becoming bigger than I supposed.

The project is still under development, but I will share some notes, workflow and the Ideas for future improvements.

## Introduction

AutoM8 is the ultimate tool for linux users to manage their Ubuntu Station. It provides a huge set of commands to automate the installation of
software on your computer.
